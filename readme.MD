# RandOS is a mock OS I made for fun when I was bored. It is not an actual OS; rather, it is meant to simulate an OS.
## DO NOT ADD OR CHANGE BUILTIN PUBLIC KEYS, NOR RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL KEYS, UNLESS YOU ARE THE CREATOR (Luna)

## Setup is simple, simply run the randos.py file. It will give you instructions, just follow the directions. An internet connection is required for the initial setup.

## To create a program of your own, you WILL NEED A KEYPAIR
### To generate a keypair, run python3.13 encodeSoftware.py genkeypair [PRIVATE KEY FILENAME] [PUBLIC KEY FILENAME]

## To trust a new keypair, put the public key in the progpubkeys directory of the filesystem
